An interesting distribution property we haven't yet discussed is **variability**. Consider, for instance, these two distributions of numerical values:\n","\n","\n","<img width=\"150\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1oLZvk-JGfbK9vrxSW3vOgyRKKGhWHHVN\">\n","\n","\n","The values of the distribution A don't vary — each value is 4. The values in distribution B  show some variability — they are not all identical, and the values can be either 8 or 0. **If we were to quantify variability**, we could assign a value of 0 to A to indicate that it has no variability. But **what variability value should we assign to distribution B?**\n","\n","We need a measure to summarize the **variability** of these two distributions. The summary metrics we've learned so far don't tell us anything about variability. The **mean**, the **median**, and the **mode** of distribution A are all 4, and distribution B has a **mean** and a **median** of 4, and **no mode**. If we were to judge variability based on these values, we'd probably have to conclude that the variabilities of the two distributions are equal, which is wrong.\n","\n","One intuitive way to measure the variability of a distribution is to find the **difference between the maximum and the minimum value**. Both the maximum and the minimum of distribution  A is 4, so the variability of distribution  is 0:\n","\n","$$\n","max(A) - min(A) = 4 - 4 = 0\n","$$\n","\n","We call this measure of variability the **range**.

One house could cost 120,000, another 240,000, and it could be that no house actually costs exactly 180,796. The **standard deviation** gives us a picture about this variability around the mean sale price. So, on average, sale prices vary by roughly 79,873 above and below a mean of 180,796.\n","\n","Below, we'll try to visualize this variability around the mean by:\n","\n","- Generating a histogram for the distribution of the **SalePrice** variable.\n","- Using vertical lines to mark the mean and the average deviations above and below the

Some sample standard deviations are lower than the population standard deviation, some are greater, some may even be equal to the population standard deviation, but on average the sample standard deviation is lower than the population standard deviation.\n","\n","We can get a good intuition for why the sample standard deviation underestimates if we think in terms of distribution spread. When we sample a population, it's generally more likely to get a sample with a spread that's lower than the population's spread.

One way to do that is to decrease the value of the denominator. For instance, in $\\frac{12}{6} = 2$, the denominator is 6. If we decrease the value of the denominator, we get a greater result: $\\frac{12}{4}=3$.\n","\n","We'll decrease by 1 the denominator in the sample standard deviation formula, which now becomes:\n","\n","\n","$$\n","SD_{sample} = \\sqrt{\\frac{(x_1 - \\overline{x})^2 + (x_2 - \\overline{x})^2 + \\ldots + (x_n - \\overline{x})^2}{n-1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\displaystyle \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\overline{x})^2}{n-1}}\n","$$\n","\n","\n","This small correction we added to the sample standard deviation (dividing by $n-1$ instead of $n$) is called **Bessel's correction**.
